                        </h2>
                        <p>In 1945, Ralph F. and Alice Stayer opened up a butcher shop with another family and named it
                            after their Wisconsin hometown – Johnsonville. Their shop featured delicious meats,
                            including sausage. Ralph F. was determined to make his brat better – not with scraps of meat
                            like other butchers used. Instead, his recipe used premium cuts of pork, better spices and a
                            better grinding technique. When sales of his bratwurst started to exceed sales of hamburger,
                            the Stayers knew they were onto something.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong> Today, Johnsonville is the most popular sausage brand in the United States</strong>
                            and is available in over 45 countries. The company remains privately owned by the Stayer
                            family and still relies on the same values and work ethic that Ralph and Alice instilled in
                            their butcher shop over 70 years ago
                        </p>
